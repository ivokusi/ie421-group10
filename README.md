I'm Ivo Kusijanovic a senior in CS at UIUC (May '26). I currently work at Novopayment, a fintech company providing financial services to banks across Latin America, as an Automation and AI Specialist. Beyond fintech, I’m passionate about cybersecurity and autonomous vehicles, particularly the hardware side. I have hands-on experience with Arduino and Raspberry Pi and am now moving into custom PCB design and manufacturing. I also prototype with FDM and SLA 3D printers and aim to expand into subtractive manufacturing (CNC) through this project.
