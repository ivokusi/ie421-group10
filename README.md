I'm Ivo Kusijanovic a senior in CS at UIUC (May '26). I currently work at Novopayment, a fintech company providing financial services to banks across Latin America, as an Automation and AI Specialist. Beyond fintech, I’m passionate about cybersecurity and autonomous vehicles, particularly the hardware side. I have hands-on experience with Arduino and Raspberry Pi and am now moving into custom PCB design and manufacturing. I also prototype with FDM and SLA 3D printers and aim to expand into subtractive manufacturing (CNC) through this project.

As an undergraduate student in Engineering Physics (expected May 2026) with a strong foundation in Computer Science, Mathematics, and Semiconductor Engineering, I bring a unique interdisciplinary skill set to the development of high-precision technologies. My technical proficiency spans embedded systems, signal processing, and algorithmic modeling, enabling me to bridge the gap between hardware implementation and computational analysis.
I’m particularly interested in timing systems, frequency stabilization, and real-time data acquisition, which lie at the core of atomic clock research and high-frequency trading (HFT) synchronization. Through my coursework and hands-on projects, I’ve developed experience in circuit design, and numerical simulation, and I’m driven by a deep curiosity for how physical systems can be optimized through computation and control.
Ultimately, I aim to contribute to the advancement of precision instrumentation and ultra-low-latency systems—technologies that define the limits of modern science and finance alike.

I’m a senior in Aerospace Engineering at UIUC (expected Dec 2025), with interests spanning control systems, autonomous robotics, and the computational tools that support modern aerospace design. My technical experience includes state-space modeling, simulation, and applied numerical methods, as well as work across aerodynamics and CFD through both coursework and project teams. I’ve worked hands-on with the Crazyflie drone platform, integrating Python flight code with embedded C controllers and experimenting with real-world behavior through hardware-in-the-loop testing. I’m continually building a better understanding of hardware, sensing, and embedded technologies (CNC) as I aim to deepen my experience with the tools that connect algorithms to real physical systems and enable the next generation of autonomous platforms.

Outside of aerospace, I follow quantitative finance, markets, and optimization closely, having worked in market analysis and portfolio research. I’m interested in how optimization and control principles translate across disciplines, from robotic autonomy to portfolio behavior, and how that same mindset can be applied to understanding emerging technologies and the decisions that shape their real-world impact.

## Installation Instructions

```bash
git clone https://[NETID]@gitlab.engr.illinois.edu/ie421_high_frequency_trading_fall_2025/ie421_hft_fall_2025_group_10/group_10_project.git
